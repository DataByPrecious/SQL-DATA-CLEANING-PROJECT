SQL Practical Exam Project from DataCamp:

**üìå Project Overview**

This project is part of the Data Analyst Associate Practical Exam (SQL Track) on DataCamp. The task involved analyzing and cleaning a grocery store dataset (products) from FoodYum, a U.S.-based grocery store chain. The analysis ensures the data is clean, accurate, and structured for decision-making around stocking products that meet a wide range of customer needs.

The project covers four main tasks:
1. Identifying missing values in year_added.
2. Cleaning the dataset based on the given data dictionary.
3. Finding price ranges for each product type.
4. Filtering specific product insights for meat and dairy categories.
